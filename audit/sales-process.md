# Sales

There are 3 contracts directly related to the sale process:

- EthealDeposit.sol
- EthealNormalSale.sol
- EthealPromoTokens.sol (and its base class AbstactVirtualToken.sol)

The PreSale period is already over and customers can buy HEAL tokens during Sale period only. 
<br>There is a limit for token distribution (hard cap): $10M or 14300* HEAL tokens.

\* - **Disclaimer**
	
	All numbers in this document are valid for the moment of audit. 
	We can not guarantee the same numbers after contracts are deployed because they can be changed by authors. 
	Please read the source code of deployed contracts to be sure.


There are 3 categories of investors:

- Non-whitelisted investors - can contribute up to 1 ETH
- Whitelisted investors - no upper limits (up to the hard cap)
- Whitelisted (offchain) investors - no upper limits (up to the hard cap)


The lowest amount to contribute for all categories of investors is 0.1 ETH.

To buy tokens, they have few options:

- call `deposit()` function of deposit contract
- send Ethers to deposit contract itself (through payable fallback function)
- call `buyTokens()` function of the normal sales contract.

The last one can be done only by whitelisted customers OR within whitelist treshold limit, otherwise it will be reverted. 
<br>Therefore it is worth to consider bying HEAL tokens through deposit contract interface. 

####Proccess flow 
From the high level perspective the sale process consist of next steps:

- Deposit (by sending to deposit contract itself or by calling `deposit()` function) any amount of Ethers. 
<br>_The deposit will be recorded, no tokens in return (yet)._
- Contact Etheal and ask for whitelist signature
- Call the `forwardTransaction()` function and use that signature to continue buying tokens process.
<br>_Tokens will be transferred to investor account._

If the request for authorisation signature was declined, investor can call `refundTransaction()` and get his money back, **after** the sale period is over.

## Depositing

Contract: [EthealDeposit.sol](https://github.com/BlockchainLabsNZ/etheal-contracts/blob/master/contracts/EthealDeposit.sol)

Pre requisites:

- address of sale contract
- address of whitelist contract

### Important Functions

  - **Fallback function** <br>is an alias for the `deposit()` function.

  - **Deposit**
<br>It records all transactions but allows to buy tokens only to whitelisted (or authorised) contributors by forwarding transaction through `forwardTransactionInternal()`. All unforwarded transactions could be refunded AFTER sale period is over by calling `refundTransaction()` function.

  - **forwardTransactionInternal**
<br>It forwards approved transactions to the `depositETH()` function of the contract saved in the `sale` (see below).  

  - **refundTransaction**
<br>Anyone can call that function after Sale is over. The investor of transaction with given ID will get his/her contribution back.

One can get bonuses by:

- early involvement
- holding tokens
- high contribution amount

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------- --> <br>
## Normal sales
Contract: [EthealNormalSales.sol](https://github.com/BlockchainLabsNZ/etheal-contracts/blob/master/contracts/EthealNormalSale.sol)

The contract regulate the Sale period and allow user to buy tokens.
There is limitation: customers can buy tokens only if the amount of ETH to contribute doesn't exceed the allowed treshold, otherwise the transaction will be reverted. 

It is not a bad idea to check how far you are from the cap with Etheal website before buying token â€“ to avoid gas spending in case if hard cap will be reached.

### Important Functions

  - **depositETH**
<br>This function is called automatically from deposit contract when whitelisted investor makes new contribution. It calls the `handleContribution()` function.

  - **buyTokens**
<br>Can be called by anyone, but only whitelisted investors can contribute more than treshold amount (1 Ether for the moment of audit). It forwards call to the `handlePayment()` function.

  - **handlePayment**
<br>It forwards call the `handleContribution ()` function (which check the if contribution doesn't reach the soft cap and exchange it for HEAL tokens) and refunds the exceeded ETH amount back to investor.

  - **handleContribution**
<br>The functions checks if:
	  - the requested amount to contribute is less than available supply,
	  - the hard cap is not reached (if so - no contribution is possible),
	  - the soft cap is not reached (is so - it starts timer before the Sale is over).

	If contribution is possible, it call the `transferToken()` function, otherwise it fires event (soft or hard cap is reached).<br>
	Finally, it returns the amount of Weis that were exchanged to HEAL tokens.

  - **transferToken**
<br>It checks if requested amount is valid (Sale is not over, non-zero amount, amount is greater or equal to a minimal contribution amount), record this contribution (investor address and contributed amount), checks if the accumulated contribution amount of that investor is allowed (if the address of contributor is not whitelisted).

After that, it calculates all bonuses (by calling the `getBonus()` function), increases the token balance of contributor accordingly and fire event `TokenPurchase()`;

  - **getBonus**
<br>It calculates bonus multiplier for the amount of tokens to transfer. It consider the day of Sale period and ETH contributed amount (for more than 10ETH and for more than 100ETH).

	It also add extra promo bonuses calculated IF contributors transfered their promo tokens (HEALP) back to the promo contract or to the sale contract or to the address `0x1`.
